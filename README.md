## Hi 👋

I'm a **Software Developer** focused on **Unity & C#**, with experience in both interactive applications and enterprise software.

I have worked on **Unity-based VR/XR projects**, where I focused on user interactions, input handling, and building consistent experiences across PC and VR platforms. I have also contributed to **enterprise-level software**, implementing features such as data filtering, reporting, multi-language support, and performance improvements.

Beyond development, I actively explore **cybersecurity fundamentals** to better understand how software systems can be built more securely and reliably. I am currently strengthening this area through certifications and hands-on learning.
