## Hi 👋

I’m a Junior Software & Game Developer with a focus on Unity (C#) and gameplay systems. I enjoy building clean, scalable, and maintainable architectures while turning ideas into functional interactive experiences.
Beyond game development, I explore cybersecurity fundamentals to better understand how software systems can be designed to be secure, predictable, and resilient. I’m currently strengthening this area through certifications and hands-on learning.
