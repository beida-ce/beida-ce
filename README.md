## Hi 👋

I’m a Software Developer focused on **Unity & C#**, with experience in both
interactive applications and enterprise software.

I’ve worked on **Unity-based VR/XR projects**, where I focused on user interaction,
input handling, and building consistent experiences across PC and VR platforms.
In parallel, I’ve contributed to **enterprise-level applications**, implementing
features such as data filtering, reporting, multi-language support, and performance
optimizations.

Beyond development, I actively explore **cybersecurity fundamentals** to better
understand how software systems can be built more securely and reliably. I’m
currently strengthening this area through certifications and hands-on learning.
