## Hi 👋

I’m a Software Developer focused on **Unity & C#**, working across interactive
applications and enterprise software.

▌ I’ve worked on **Unity-based VR/XR projects**, focusing on user interaction,
input handling, and building consistent experiences across PC and VR platforms.

▌ I’ve also contributed to **enterprise-level software**, implementing data
filtering, reporting, multi-language support, and performance optimizations.

▌ Beyond development, I explore **cybersecurity fundamentals** to better understand
how software systems can be designed to be more secure, predictable, and resilient.
I’m currently strengthening this area through certifications and hands-on learning.
